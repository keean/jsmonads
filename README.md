jsmonads
========
Implementation of monads in JavaScript, building from the identity monad, through maybe, either, list, stream (comonad), continuation, to an ErrorCPS (continuation-passing-style) monad. There is also a test suite for checking whether the monad laws for each kind of monad hold on the different monads.
